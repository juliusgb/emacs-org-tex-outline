Produces a pdf outline of the notes written in emacs org-mode using the latex
outline package.

The latex outline package allows only 4 levels of depth and will have the form:
I. First main point
  A. First major sub-point of I.
    1. Sup-point of A.
      a. sub-point of 1.

  B. Second major sub-point.
    1. Sub-point of B.

II. Second main point.

Any level deeper than 4 is shown as a bullet point.

Please note that at the moment, this works with org-mode-6.30e. 
This version of org-mode uses the soul latex package when exporting to latex.
