Produces a pdf outline of the notes written in emacs org-mode using the latex
outline package.

The latex outline package allows only 4 levels of depth and will have the form:
I. First main point
  A. First major sub-point of I.
    1. Sup-point of A.
      a. sub-point of 1.
        * all other sub-points
  B. Second major sub-point.

II. Second main point.

Any level deeper than 4 is shown as a bullet point.

********************

Please note that at the moment, when the outline export command is executed,
it just prints "hello world" in the minibuffer. Maybe others can develop it
further.

Download:
********************

 $ http://github.com/juliusgb/emacs-org-tex-outline.git

Installation:

  1. Save org-export-latex-outline.el in the /path/to/org-mode/lisp/
     directory.
  2. Apply the email-formatted patch to both org-exp.el and org-install.el.
  3. Re-start emacs.

The interactive function can be called by

M-x `org-export-latex-as-outline'

Notes:
********************

The difficult part is exporting the body. Unlike the latex article class,
which automatically numbers the sections of the notes written in org-mode
based on the number of stars, the latex outline package requires you to
manually number your outline (maybe I'm missing something or I'm using an
unsuitable latex package).

The current solution is to transfer that manual numbering to myself as I
write the outline, resulting in an org file of this format:

   * I. Main Point 1.
     ** A. Sub-point of 1.
       *** 1. Sub-sub-point of 1.
       *** 2. Sub-sub-point of 2.
     ** B. Sub-point of 1.
   * II. Main Point 2.
     ** A. Sub-point of 2.
   * III. Main Point 3.

Talk about ugly and the inconvenience when you move the subtrees.

It would be ideal if:
  (1) the numbering was done automatically based on the number of stars on
      each heading,
  (2) we had the option to customise our own numbering at the top of the
      org file just as we can customise whether to include the date or table
      of contents at the top an org file that's to be exported to latex.

The code is pre-pre-alpha. Any suggestions / contributions warmly welcomed.
