Produces a pdf outline of the notes written in emacs org-mode using the latex
outline package.

The latex outline package allows only 4 levels of depth and will have the form:
I. First main point
  A. First major sub-point of I.
    1. Sup-point of A.
      a. sub-point of 1.

  B. Second major sub-point.
    1. Sub-point of B.

II. Second main point.

Any level deeper than 4 is shown as a bullet point.


Current state:
********************

Please note that at the moment, this works with org-6.10a. I wanted to have a
working version before porting it to the current version of org-mode.

Now that it's working, let the porting begin!
