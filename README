Produces a pdf outline of the notes written in emacs org-mode using the latex
outline package.

The latex outline package allows only 4 levels of depth and will have the form:
I. First main point
  A. First major sub-point of I.
    1. Sup-point of A.
      a. sub-point of 1.
        * all other sub-points
  B. Second major sub-point.

II. Second main point.

Any level deeper than 4 is shown as a bullet point.


Current state:
********************

Please note that at the moment, when the outline export command is executed,
the resulting pdf is outlined, i.e., indented, but not numbered as the format above.

Download:

 $ http://github.com/juliusgb/emacs-org-tex-outline.git

Installation:

  1. Save org-export-latex-outline.el in the /path/to/org-mode/lisp/
     directory.
  2. Apply the patches to both org-exp.el, org-install.el and org-export-latex.el.
  3. Re-start emacs.
  4. Add #+LATEX_CLASS: outline to the top of the org file you wish to export as
    an outline.

The interactive function can be called by

M-x `org-export-latex-as-outline'

Notes:
********************

The difficult part is exporting the body. Unlike the latex article class,
which automatically numbers the sections of the notes written in org-mode
based on the number of stars, the latex outline package requires you to
manually number your outline (maybe I'm missing something or I'm using an
unsuitable latex package).

I've discovered that elisp code can't be executed where the outline class is
defined in org-export-latex.el. See the association list which consists of other
latex classes.

The workaround is to create a custom latex package that handles the formatting and
numbering of the headlines so that:
  (1)  We don't manually number the headlines
  (2)  It's easy to use with org-mode since the custom latex package would take
       the headline as an argument and format it, something the outline package
       doesn't do.

That's what I'm working on.


The code is pre-alpha. Any suggestions / contributions warmly welcomed.
